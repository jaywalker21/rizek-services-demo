# This is the service demo for Rizek

## How to start local?
- Clone this Github repository
- One the repo is cloned, run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start`
- After that the application should be up and running on port `5000`.
- For demo, the service endpoint is deployed in [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), which may go down (free tier) anytime, in such case, please host the [Service](https://github.com/jaywalker21/rizek-services-demo) on local and make changes in [UI Code](https://github.com/jaywalker21/rizek-demo)

## Future Scope

- Unit Test Cases and robust testing. 
- Code Cleanup and organization
- Make error logic more generic and reusable.
- Use `nodemon` and `pm2` config setup for future deployment/hosting purpose.
